## Security Measures

SaviTools implements the following security measures:

### API Protection

- **CORS**: Restricted origins via `WEB_ORIGIN` environment variable
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable via `THROTTLE_LIMIT` and `THROTTLE_TTL`
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated using class-validator

### Webhook Security

- **HMAC-SHA256 Signing**: Outbound webhooks are signed when `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` is configured
- **Timestamp Verification**: Replay protection with configurable time window (default 300s)
- **Signature Header**: `X-SaviTools-Signature` with format `sha256=<hex>`

### Authentication

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management with refresh token rotation
- **Password Hashing**: Argon2 for password storage

### Network Security

- **SSRF Protection**: Guards on outbound requests from Playground and Webhook modules
- **TLS**: All external API calls use HTTPS
